# credit-agricole-ofx-fix

Takes as input an OFX generated by Crédit Agricole and output a fixed version. This is particularl useful if you use Microsoft Money which otherwise refuse to import the new version.

Starting 2019, some Crédit Agricole subsidiaries Websites were updated to a new version. Their OFX export is now buggy. This includes:

* Crédit Agricole Ile de France
* BforBank (from what I can read, not tested)

## How to Build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## How to use

Instead of directly using `CAYYYYMMDD_NUM.ofx` file downloaded from the CA Website, save it locally and fix it.

```bash
java -jar build/libs/credit-agricole-ofx-fix-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -f ~/Downloads/CAYYYMMDD_NUM.ofx -o fixed.ofx
```

Then use the fixed version (`fixed.ofx`).
