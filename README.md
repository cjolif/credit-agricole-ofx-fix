# credit-agricole-ofx-fix

Takes as input an OFX generated by Crédit Agricole and output a fixed version. This is particularl useful if you use Microsoft Money which otherwise refuse to import the new version.

Starting 2019, some Crédit Agricole subsidiaries Websites were updated to a new version. Their OFX export is now buggy. This includes:

* Crédit Agricole Ile de France
* BforBank (from what I can read, not tested)
